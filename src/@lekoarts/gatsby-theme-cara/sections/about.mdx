## About

Hello People,
This is Dhiraj Kumar Burnwal from Kolkata, India. I am final year engineering undergrad from [Netaji Subhash Engineering College](https://www.nsec.ac.in/). I love messing with datasets, finding patterns and hidden insights behind it. I am interested in python development, data analysis and data engineering profiles.  I have some of my personal data analysis projects. 
Also, I'm quite active in extra-curricular activities in College and now serving in [PHOENIX - Official Tech Club of NSEC](https://phoenixnsec.in) as PRESIDENT.
